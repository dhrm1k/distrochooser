This github issue looks promising: https://github.com/distrochooser/distrochooser/issues/226


The project is great. I liked it, but I can't reason why django was used to build it. It takes a lot of time to load. Rebuild the whole project in something better. I can use the browser storage api or maybe i dont understand the project codebase. I will look into it.
